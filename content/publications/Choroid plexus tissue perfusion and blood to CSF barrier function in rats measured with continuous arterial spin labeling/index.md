subtitle:"H Lee, B Ozturk, MS Stringer, S Koundal, BJ MacIntosh, D Rothman and H Benveniste"
excerpt: "The choroid plexus (ChP) of the cerebral ventricles is a source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production and also plays a key role in immune surveillance at the level of blood-to-CSF-barrier (BCSFB). In this study, we quantify ChP blood perfusion and BCSFB mediated water exchange from arterial blood into ventricular CSF using non-invasive continuous arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance imaging (CASL-MRI).
