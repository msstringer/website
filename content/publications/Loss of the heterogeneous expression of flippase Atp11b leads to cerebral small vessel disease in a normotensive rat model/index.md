excerpt: "Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is the leading cause of vascular dementia, causes a quarter of strokes, and worsens stroke outcomes. The disease is characterised by patchy cerebral small vessel and white matter pathology, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We generated a novel normotensive transgenic rat model, where Atp11b is deleted, and show pathological, imaging and behavioural changes typical of those in human SVD, but that occur without hypertension."
