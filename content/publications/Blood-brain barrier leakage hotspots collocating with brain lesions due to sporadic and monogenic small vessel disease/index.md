## Abstract

### Introduction

Blood-brain barrier (BBB) is known to be impaired in cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), and is measurable by dynamic-contrast enhancement (DCE)-MRI.

### Methods

In a cohort of 69 patients (42 sporadic, 27 monogenic SVD), who underwent 3T MRI, including DCE and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) sequences, we assessed the relationship of BBB-leakage hotspots to SVD lesions (lacunes, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and microbleeds). We defined as hotspots the regions with permeability surface area product highest decile on DCE-derived maps within the white matter. We assessed factors associated with the presence and number of hotspots corresponding to SVD lesions in multivariable regression models adjusted for age, WMH volume, number of lacunes, and SVD type.

### Results

We identified hotspots at lacune edges in 29/46 (63%) patients with lacunes, within WMH in 26/60 (43%) and at the WMH edges in 34/60 (57%) patients with WMH, and microbleed edges in 4/11 (36%) patients with microbleeds. In adjusted analysis, lower WMH-CVR was associated with presence and number of hotspots at lacune edges, and higher WMH volume with hotspots within WMH and at WMH edges, independently of the SVD type.

### Discussion

In conclusion, SVD lesions frequently collocate with high BBB-leakage in patients with sporadic and monogenic forms of SVD.
