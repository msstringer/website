  I am a medical physicist and research fellow working in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research at the University of Edinburgh. Most of my research focuses on measuring how well blood vessels are working using MRI. I have worked at the University of Edinburgh since 2016, before which I completed my PhD at the University of Aberdeen (2012-2016) working on brain imaging, and degrees in applied and pure mathematics (Heriot-Watt University and University of Glasgow).
  
  I have worked on different international studies using advanced brain imaging and image analysis techniques to understand how damage to the brain causes more severe disease. I was heavily involved with the H2020 funded SVDs\@Target project as well as a Leducq Transatlantic Network on perivascular spaces. 
  
  In addition to my research experience I have also been involved with teaching through Edinburgh Imaging Academy. I have also supervised several student projects at Masters and Honours level, as well as a PhD student (Emilie Sleight) due to submit in the coming months.
  
  The below links explain different aspects of my work in more detail.
